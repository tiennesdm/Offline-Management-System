- **Upload Animations**: Users can upload new Lottie animations to the system.
- **Download Animations**: Users can download Lottie animations for offline use.
- **Offline Capabilities**: The application supports offline use, allowing users to view and interact with animations and metadata without an internet connection.

## Technologies

The application uses the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Redux (for state management)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Additional Tools**: Service Workers for offline support, Lottie Library for rendering animations, Redux Persist for store management, Webpack for configuration, jest and react testing lib

      ```
5. **GRAPHQL QUERY AND MUTATION**
    ```
    1. export const UPLOAD_LOTTIE =`
    mutation uploadLottie($file: Upload!, $name: String!, $description: String!) {
    uploadLottie(file: $file, name: $name, description: $description) {
      id
      filename
      mimetype
      encoding
      url
      name
      description
      isValidLottie
     }
     }
    `;
    2. export const GET_LOTTIES = gql`
        query GetLotties {
         lotties {
           id
           filename
           mimetype
           encoding
           url
           name
          description
          isValidLottie
       }
      }
    `;
    3. export const SEARCH_LOTTIES = gql`
        query SearchLotties($query: String!) {
          searchLotties(query: $query) {
           id
           filename
           mimetype
           encoding
          url
          name
          description
         isValidLottie
       }
      }
     `;
     ```
